# Artifact 1 

This artifact is a project from CS-320 Module 3 that I made in January 2025. This project is a very basic contact manager system written in Java. It allows the user to add, save, update, and remove contacts.  

I included this artifact because the original version was very basic, and I wanted to make something much more advanced. The new version has been revised and has a completely functional user interface. This would allow me to showcase my skills with OOP, software design, and GUI development. To create the GUI, I used the JavaFX library, which was a good way to show that I can also work with JavaFX. 

The enhancements I made here met all the course outcomes that I wanted to meet. It showed that I can design, develop, and deliver well written code. My comments show that I can communicate what is happening in a way that makes sense. It also shows that I can design a plan and execute it successfully. 

While working on the enhancements, I learned how to implement a login-authentication system. This will be the first thing a user has to do when they open the application. I also learned how to work with tables using JavaFX, which also happened to be my main challenge. Getting the table to display the contacts took some time to figure it out. I also had an issue where when I automatically assign an ID to a contact, it would skip numbers. Not the biggest issue because the ID would still be unique, but it bothered me, so I had to fix it. I also learned what varargs parameters are. 



# Artifact 2 

This artifact is the same one I used for enhancement 1. It was originally created a year ago in CS-320 Module 3. It is a basic contact management application written in Java, 

I decided to continue working on this artifact to transform it into a more flushed out contact management system. The first enhancement focused on creating a GUI. This enhancement focuses on usability. I added ways to sort and filter the table efficiently. This showcases my ability to work with data structures and algorithms. All the course outcomes that I planned to meet with this enhancement were met.  

While enhancing this artifact, I learned how to utilize FilteredLists and SortedLists. These proved to be very useful for implementing search, filter, and sort features. One of the main challenges I faced was when I tried to sort by ID. When I would press sort, it would do it like “1, 10, 11, 12, etc”. The issue was that I made the ID a string so instead of sorting it numerically, it was sorting it lexicographically. I decided to make ID an int and had to revise some code to fit this change. 



# Artifact 3

This artifact is the same one I used for enhancement 1 and enhancement 2. This project is from CS-320 Module 3, and I made it in January 2025. This project is a very basic contact manager system written in Java. It allows the user to add, save, update, and remove contacts.   

I decided to continue working on this artifact because I just finished creating a user interface for it and expanding its functionality. I now wanted to hook it up to a database and have persistent storage. This would be a good way to showcase that I can implement and work with databases. It also showed that I could specifically work with SQLite on Java. I was able to meet all the course outcomes that I planned to meet.  

This enhancement definitely proved to be the hardest. During my time at SNHU, we worked with implementing and working with databases a couple of times. This was usually done with a guide to follow, but for my enhancement I didn’t really have a guide. I was still able to complete the enhancement successfully, but it took a little bit of research. A problem that I was having was that I wasn’t able to see the database has I modified it, but I was able to download a plugin that allowed me to.
